/*
FlattedFifth, August 1, 2024:
Created a new column in baseitems.2da, "WeaponCategory". This column is now used in
x2_inc_itemprop.nss to determine the basic type of weapon instead of checking against 
a list of ids. This is more maintainable in the future if we add more weapons. Possible values:
melee = non-creature melee weapon
creaturemelee - creature melee weapon (claws, fangs, etc)
creatureranged = none yet, but its possible future pc races might have access to built in creature ranged, manticore spikes
launcher = bows, crossbows, slings
projectile = arrows, bolts, bullets
projectilequiver = items that spawn the above
thrown = darts, throwing axes
thrownquiver = items that spawn the above

So if, for example, you wanted an npc to remove all weapons from a character, you could search for 
all base items that have an entry in this column that contains "melee", "creature", or "thrown". If you only
want creature weapons, you search for creature. If you need to explicitly allow or prevent the usage of the
item spawn "quivers" you search for "quiver".
