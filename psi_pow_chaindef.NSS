/*
Chain of Defensive Posture (Ex)
At 2nd level, a war mind learns the second principle of warfare for the individual combatant: 
the ability to avoid the enemyâ€™s counterattacks if that enemy is not immediately overwhelmed. 
Calling upon inner reserves of knowledge and dedication, 
a war mind can provide himself with a +2 insight bonus to Dodge for up to 1 minute. A war mind can use this power three times per day.
 Activating this power is a free action. At 8th level, the insight bonus to dodge improves to +5.
